Northern States Power Company Logo. Png,Northern States Power Company,"Minneapolis, MN",Tier II: Advanced Reactor Development Project,LWR Integrated Energy Systems Interface Technology Development & Demonstration,"Under this proposal the principal objective is to carry out planning, design, installation, testing, demonstration, and evaluation of non-electric, hybrid energy technologies connected to a light-water reactor (LWR) power plant. The expected result of this project is to have both a fully-functional hydrogen plant capable of operating as a hybrid system to test diverse electrolysis technologies coupled with a LWR and the design development for a hybrid reversible system. Both project deliverables are to be integrated into the normal operating routine of a nuclear power plant.","$11,014,135 ","$2,755,495 ","$13,769,630 ",2020 - Round 3,Negotiating Award Terms,https://www.energy.gov/sites/prod/files/2020/10/f79/IND%20FOA%20FY20__%20Summary-Abstract%20ARD-20-22098%20Northern%20States%20Power.pdf,44.977753,-93.265015,

The system will be critically verified and validated through collaboration with INL such that it will be ready to integrate into the nuclear environment. These efforts will enable modular 200 to 500 MW SOEC utility scale systems to be available to the market and demonstrate how nuclear-hydrogen production operations can help nuclear plants diversify and increase their profitability by switching between electricity production and hydrogen generation.","$10,000,000 ","$2,500,000 ","$12,500,000 ",2020 - Round 3,Negotiating Award Terms,https://www.energy.gov/sites/prod/files/2020/10/f79/IND%20FOA%20FY2020%20Summary-Abstract%20ARD-20-23636%20-%20FuelCell.pdf,41.394817,-73.454010,
